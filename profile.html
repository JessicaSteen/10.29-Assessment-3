    <h2> Skills</h2>
    <p> I would not say that I am a expert in many skills but that I have
        come to know a little about alot(maybe not too much). I enjoy building 
        my skills in the follwing areas: 
        <ul>
            <li>rollerstaking </li> 
            <li> cooking </li> 
            <li> snowboarding </li> 
            <li> health and fitness </li> 
            <li>hiking and backpacking </li> 
            <li>and most recently coding </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>

<div class ="features" id="interest">
    <h2>Interest</h2>
    <p> I would say that my skills are reflective of my interest. I love being 
        outdoors; so hiking, camping, backpacking and snowboarding align with that.
        I also enjoy being healthy and active (but I can also be very sloth-like), which 
        compliments many skills listed.
        Otherwise, I enjoy good movies/television, music, naps, spending time with my
        dogs, chocolate. 
        <h3><center>Do naps count as an interest?</h3></center>
        <p><center>Select yes or no below </center> </p>
        <form>
            <input type = "radio" id="yes"/> <label for="yes">Yes</label>
            <input type ="radio" id="no"/> <label for="no">No</label>
        </form> 
         
    </p>

<div class ="features" id="career-goals">
    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p> As it stands at this moment, I do not know what my career goals are.
        I would say that its difficult to know at this moment because I am so new
        to the field--and came from an opposite field. To be honest, I want to have 
        a job that is more lucrative, and 
        feel like I am being creative and learning new concepts. I dont want to feel
        stagnant.
